# Pong-Game-Python

Very basic pong game. 
 The only error I found in many plays is sometimes the ball will go through the top of the paddle if you try to hit it at an angle.
 It was written completely in Jupyter Notebook. 
 It's for my computer science class. 
 Created this all by myself.
 Thank you.
